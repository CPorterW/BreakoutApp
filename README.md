# Overview

This is my first attempt at creating an app. I have a simple web breakout game, and I want to convert it into an app. I hope that by the end of this project I will be able to convert any website into an app. 

This is supposed to be a breakout game, but this project has a long way to go before it becomes usable. Open a terminal, navigate into this folder, and run npx expo start. Then type w to test it on a computer, i for an IPhone, or a for Android You can click to move the paddle, but you will see that the mechanics are busted.

I want to expand this game into something I would be eager to play if I had come across it on a game publishing site like Kongregate.
